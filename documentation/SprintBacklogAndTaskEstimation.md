## Sprint Backlog + Task Estimation

Having already created a use case diagram and class diagram, we are ready to move onto the sprint backlog.

Sprint Backlog is a Scrum Artifact

### Background on Scrum

Scrum is an agile framework used for developing and delivering software in short periods of time.
These short periods of time are called sprints, generally a 2 week period that starts with a **Sprint plan** and ends with shippable code.

### Sprint Backlog

A **Sprint Backlog** is a Scrum artifact.
It contains

- User Stories (informal description of a feature to be available)
- Tasks. Within the user stories we have tasks that need be **done** to complete user story
  - These Tasks are a subset of product backlog(list of all tasks) to be completed within a given sprint.

The Sprint backlog is designed to be mutable so tasks can be added or updated if need be.
This is another way that scrum supports agile development.
