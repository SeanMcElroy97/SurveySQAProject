## Sprint Backlog + Task Estimation

Having already created a use case diagram and class diagram, we are ready to move onto the sprint backlog.

Sprint Backlog is a Scrum Artifact

### Background on Scrum

Scrum is an agile framework used for developing and delivering software in short periods of time.
These short periods of time are called sprints, generally a 2 week period that starts with a **Sprint plan** and ends with shippable code.

### Sprint Backlog

A **Sprint Backlog** is a Scrum artifact.
It contains

- User Stories (informal description of a feature to be available)
- Tasks. Within the user stories we have tasks that need be **done** to complete user story
  - These Tasks are a subset of product backlog(list of all tasks) to be completed within a given sprint.

The Sprint backlog is designed to be mutable so tasks can be added or updated if need be.
This is another way that scrum supports agile development.

### Sprint Backlog Categories

The Sprint Backlog/Sprint board can be broken down into 3 categories

1. To-Do
   - Tasks that have to be started
2. In-Progress
   - Tasks that a developer has begun working on but are not complete
3. Done
   - This can be misconstrued. It means the task has been tested and passed and is completely ready for merging into release branch.

### Prioritization

Prioritization is the process of ensuring the most essential functionality gets done first. The process becomes more difficult the larger the list of tasks becomes.
A methodoly i decided to use when prioritizing the functionality a.k.a my user stories was the **"MoSCoW Rules"**

### MoSCoW Rules

- Must Have.

  - User stories that are part of core functionality. Essential.
  - (**Create Survey**, **Respond to Survey**).

- Should Have

  - These feauture are not part of core functionality but equally important.
  - (**View Survey**).

- Could Have

  - Not core or necessary but would benefit the feature.
    - (A not so important part of View Survey story is **"survey statistics"**).

- Won't Have
  - Most likely will not have time to implement, but potentially in a later sprint.
  - (E.g A user interface feature for survey project).
