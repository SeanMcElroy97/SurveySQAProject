# Code Review Checklist

### Code Review

Mentioned briefly in the last section on Team Version Control.

Code reviews are neccessary to maintain consistency and minimize defects.
Its achieved by ideally, having as many team members as possible checking a software program, mainly by viewing/reading parts of the source code.
Code Reviews have been proven to accelerate the software development process.

In order to perform successful Code Reviews, a standard process for Code Reviews should be created and followed so the same standard of review is maintained for each PR(Pull Request).
Thats why a set of standard checks, known as your **'Code Review Checklist'** should be created.
Every team should configure their own checklist. This will lead to a common understanding and agreement for each step.
