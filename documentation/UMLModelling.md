## Diagraming Tool

I used **lucidChart** for my diagrams. Lucid chart is a web-based app that enables visual communication of complex systems.
Supports flowcharts, process maps, **UML models** and organizational charts.
It also supports collaboration for teams to utilize for better data visualization.

### Use Case Diagram

A use case diagram is a simple representation of a user(s) interaction with a system/feature/app.
It's a high-level view that helps highlight

- Users involved
- Possible use cases
- Relationships the user(s) have with the different use cases

Use case diagrams are great way to convey an idea. It allows your team members to see exactly how the user will interact with app.
They are a great starting point for development.
Non-technical people can view the use case diagram and get a general undertsanding of the application

For our survey project, the use case diagram looks like this...
