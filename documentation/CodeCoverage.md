# Code Coverage

Code coverage or test coverage is a way of quantifying the amount of your source code that is being tested.

- Measurement of how many lines of code are executed while automated tests are running.

- It is used as an exit criteria for each milestone. E.g. Sprint

- In our example the specific code coverage metric will be coverage from unit tests.

- Typically a good code coverage percentage is 85%-90%. - i.e. This is the percentage of your code is covered by testing.

- The higher the percentage of code coverage. The more confident you can be about bugs and defects.

- A high percentage does not mean your code is well tested. The quality of your unit tests will determine that.

- A popular tool used for Code Coverage is SonarQube.

- Many IDE's have in built code coverage. Since I'm using IntelliJ, I will use inbuilt code coverage provided by intelliJ.
