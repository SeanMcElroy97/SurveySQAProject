# Code Coverage

Code coverage or test coverage is a way of quantifying the amount of your source code that is being tested.

Measurement of how many lines of code are executed while automated tests are running.

It is used as an exit criteria for each milestone. E.g. Sprint

In our example the specific code coverage metric will be coverage from unit tests.
