# Code Coverage

Code coverage or test coverage is a way of quantifying the amount of your source code that is being tested.

- Measurement of how many lines of code are executed while automated tests are running.

- It is used as an exit criteria for each milestone. E.g. Sprint

- In our example the specific code coverage metric will be 'coverage from unit tests'.

- Typically a good code coverage percentage is **85% - 90%**. - i.e. This is the percentage of your code that is covered by testing.

- The higher the percentage of code coverage, the less likelihood that bugs and defects will be an issue.

- A high coverage percentage does not mean your code is well tested. The quality of your unit tests will determine that.

- A popular tool used for Code Coverage is SonarQube.

  - Provides Macro metrics like Complexity.
  - Can see trends of code coverage. e.g. Is are coverage getting better or worse?

- Many IDE's have in built code coverage. Since I'm using IntelliJ, I will us the inbuilt code coverage tool provided by intelliJ.
