# Team Version Control

### Version Control

- Version control is a system that tracks/records changes to a file or set of files over time.
- Allows you to recall specific version later.
- Facilitated by **Version Control System**.
  - popular ones include 'AWS Code Commit' and **'Git'**.

### Team Version Control

- This is version control but with many people involved with the same file or set of files.
- This is a standard process in a software development team.
- This adds to risk of complications.
- complications like conflicts due to same file being changed by 2 developers.
- Another complication could be conflict of edits being made to different versions of files.
